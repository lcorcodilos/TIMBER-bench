# TIMBER Bench

Tool to run and maintain TIMBER validation and benchmarking tasks. Built to handle the JME modules in comparison to the NanoAOD-tools but infrastructure could be used for other purposes of running and tracking tests.

Uses an SQlite database to track runs locally.

### Needs and Wants
- [ ] Validation via SQL querries (Query SQL database to get comparable root files to compare).
- [ ] Tools to select runs via SQL and display via a table or graph
